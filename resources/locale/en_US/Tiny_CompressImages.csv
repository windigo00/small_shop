"Tiny_CompressImages::TinyPNG uses smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of your PNG files. By selectively decreasing the number of colors in the image, fewer bytes are required to store the data. The effect is nearly invisible but it makes a very large difference in file size!","TinyPNG uses smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of your PNG files.

"Tiny_CompressImages::Why should I use TinyPNG?","Why should I use TinyPNG?"
"Tiny_CompressImages::PNG is useful because it's the only widely supported format that can store partially transparent images. The format uses compression, but the files can still be large. Use TinyPNG to shrink images for your apps and sites. It will use less bandwidth and load faster.","PNG is useful because it's the only widely supported format that can store partially transparent images.

"Tiny_CompressImages::How does the extension work?","How does the extension work?"
"Tiny_CompressImages::When a users visits the store view, the TinyPNG will automatically compress the images on the fly. This only applies for images that are not already cached. So in order to optimize all images, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"%s\">flush your entire images cache</a> so your whole images database will be optimized. When test mode is enabled, the images will also be compressed on the fly, however, compressed images will not be saved to disk. The result can be found in the status log, which can be downloaded in the <a href=\"#tiny_compressimages_logging-head\">Log section</a> tab of this extension.","When a users visits the store view, the TinyPNG will automatically compress the images on the fly.
